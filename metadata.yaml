summary: |
  PostgreSQL Database Injector Charm

description: |
  This charm can be related to a postgresql-k8s charm (using the db-admin relation), and
  this charm will execute the SQL tar dump given as a resource.

  If the refresh-period (minutes) is non-zero, this charm will reexecute the SQL tar dump
  after that number of minutes have passed since the last update.

  This charm can be configured with the db-user config option, which will be the new
  owner of the newly created data (otherwise, consumers of that database will encounter
  Permission Denied errors).

  db-admin:
    interface: pgsql
